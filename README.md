a fast, local-first terminal ebook reader and calibre library manager for linux. it reads epub, pdf, mobi, fb2, comic archives, markdown, and images in a keyboard-driven tui.

## features

- reads epub, epub3, pdf, fb2, txt, markdown, cbz, cbr, cb7, png, jpeg, gif, webp, bmp, and svg

- opens on an all-books dashboard with list and card views
- groups formats for the same book and prefers epub when it is available
- finds any indexed book through an independent picker with cover and metadata details
- saves reading progress and bookmarks automatically
- opens local files and http or https urls with a private offline cache

## install

mereader-tui supports linux with a utf-8 locale. building needs gcc 14 or later, or clang 18 or later. it also needs rust 1.97, cargo, make, and `pkg-config`.

clone the repository with its pinned fff submodule:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/whitehades/mereader-tui.git
cd mereader-tui
rustup toolchain install 1.97.0 --profile minimal
```

if the repository was cloned without submodules, run:

```sh
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### ubuntu and debian

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install build-essential pkg-config libncurses-dev libsqlite3-dev \
  libglib2.0-dev libxml2-dev libzip-dev libarchive-dev libpcre2-dev \
  libgdk-pixbuf-2.0-dev libpoppler-glib-dev libcairo2-dev \
  libcurl4-openssl-dev librsvg2-common
```

### fedora

```sh
sudo dnf install gcc make pkgconf-pkg-config ncurses-devel sqlite-devel \
  glib2-devel libxml2-devel libzip-devel libarchive-devel pcre2-devel \
  gdk-pixbuf2-devel poppler-glib-devel cairo-devel libcurl-devel librsvg2
```

### arch linux

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel pkgconf ncurses sqlite glib2 libxml2 \
  libzip libarchive pcre2 gdk-pixbuf2 poppler-glib cairo curl librsvg
```

install for the current user without root:

```sh
make doctor
make
make user-install
hash -r
mereader-tui --doctor
```

make sure `~/.local/bin` is in `PATH`. use `sudo make install` for a system-wide install under `/usr/local`.

the install contains `mereader-tui`, `libfff_c.so`, the default config, the `mereader-tui(1)` manual, and both project licenses. rust is needed to build from source, but not to run an installed build.

uninstall with `make user-uninstall` or `sudo make uninstall`. uninstalling does not delete personal config, history, bookmarks, or cached books.

## usage

```sh
mereader-tui                              # open the library
mereader-tui book.epub                    # open a local book
mereader-tui "path with spaces/book.pdf" # quoted paths work
mereader-tui https://example.com/book.epub
mereader-tui -r                           # print reading history
mereader-tui 3                            # open history row 3
mereader-tui alice wonderland             # fuzzy-match history
mereader-tui --doctor                     # print runtime diagnostics
```

run `man mereader-tui` for the complete command reference.

## library

set `LibraryPath` in `~/.config/mereader-tui/config.ini` to a calibre library or an ordinary folder of books. `LibraryPath = auto` checks `~/Calibre Library` and `~/Documents/Calibre Library`. `MEREADER_TUI_LIBRARY_PATH` overrides the config for one process.

a folder containing `metadata.db` is treated as a calibre library. the first shelf shows all logical books. the author shelf groups those books by author. ordinary folders use their directory structure as metadata when possible. files with the same stem are grouped as formats of one book.

| key | action |
| --- | --- |
| `j`, `k`, arrows | move the selection |
| `ctrl-f`, `ctrl-b`, page keys | move by one screen |
| `gg`, `G` | select the first or last item |
| `enter`, `l` | open the selected item |
| `/` | filter the current shelf through fff |
| `space space` | find any book with a cover and details preview |
| `v` | switch between list and card views |
| `a` | switch between all books and authors |
| `f` | choose a format for the selected book |
| `backspace`, `esc`, `h` | go back or clear the filter |
| `s` | cycle recent, title, and author sorting |
| `r` | rescan the library |
| `o` | open a path or url |
| `?` | show library help |
| `q` | quit |

epub is preferred over pdf, mobi or azw, and other supported formats. press `f` to choose a different format. that choice is saved for the book.

## reader

| key | action |
| --- | --- |
| `j`, `k`, arrows | scroll |
| `ctrl-f`, `ctrl-b`, page keys | move by pages |
| `gg`, `G` | jump to the beginning or end |
| `/`, `f2` | search forward or backward |
| `n`, `N` | repeat the search |
| `ctrl-o`, `ctrl-i` | move through jump history |
| `tab` | open the table of contents |
| `b`, `B` | save or list bookmarks |
| `M` | show metadata |
| `v` | switch pdf fixed and reflow views |
| `?`, `f1` | show all configured keys |
| `f12` | save the current terminal view as svg |
| `q`, `esc` | cancel or quit |

numeric prefixes repeat movement commands, such as `12j`, `3n`, or `120G`.

## config

mereader-tui creates `~/.config/mereader-tui/config.ini` on first use. these are the main defaults:

```ini
[General]
PreferredImageViewer = auto
LibraryPath = auto
MaxTextWidth = 80
TextJustification = justify
Pretty = no
PageScrollDuration = 0.2
ImageMode = auto

[Color Dark]
Background = #1d1c2b
Foreground = #cdd6f4
Accent = #cba6f7

[Color Light]
Background = #eff1f5
Foreground = #4c4f69
Accent = #8839ef
```

the shipped palette is based on catppuccin mocha and latte. see `resources/config.ini` for every key mapping.

## native fff integration

mereader-tui is written in c23. fff remains rust and is compiled from the pinned submodule into `libfff_c.so`. mereader-tui calls the fff c abi in the same process. it does not launch an fff command or need neovim.

the c adapter owns copied paths and scores. rust owns the opaque index and temporary fff results, which are released through matching c destructors.

## development

```sh
make test          # native and cli tests
make test-gcc      # clean gcc build
make test-clang    # clean clang build
make sanitize      # address and undefined behavior sanitizers
make installcheck  # staged install and uninstall
make format        # format c sources and headers
```

fff is pinned as a git submodule, so builds use a reviewed source revision and a locked cargo dependency graph.

## limits

- kindle print replica and azw4 books are not supported
- drm-protected mobi or azw files are not supported
- pdf reflow and search need an embedded text layer
- password-protected pdfs and encrypted comic archives are not supported
- document search works on laid-out lines, so a phrase split by wrapping may need a regular expression such as `word +next`
- direct image decoding is bounded; oversized or corrupt images remain placeholders

## license

gpl 3.0. the bundled fff component uses the mit license. both licenses are installed with mereader-tui.
